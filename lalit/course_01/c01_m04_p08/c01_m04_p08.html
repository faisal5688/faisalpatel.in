                                                    GVV is focused on building your skills to respond directly to address unethical behavior before it happens. In this case, the partner, manager, and associate could have made different choices personally. In speaking up to address this issue on their team,
                                                    they may also have helped others avoid making a poor choice and the slippery slope that often follows to more unethical actions. </p>

                                                    While having the skills to respond directly when faced with unethical action is critically important, the firm also offers many channels of communication to support you in speaking up. Remember, you never have to go it alone. </p>

                                                    Handing an issue in the moment is something we want to empower everyone to do. However, sometimes it doesn’t end at that moment. In some instances, even after the immediate issue is resolved, you still need to report issues through those channels. </p>
