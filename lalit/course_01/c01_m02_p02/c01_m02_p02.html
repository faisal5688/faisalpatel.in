									<p><b>Fear</b></p>
									<p>Being afraid of negative impact to yourself or to others can make it feel unsafe to speak up. Part of a Speak Up culture involves addressing these concerns and ensuring everyone feels both safe and encouraged to raise concerns. </p>

                               <div class="p_box2 box">
									<p><b>Response </b></p>
									<p>Believing that nothing will be done if you speak up is a barrier for some people to raise concerns.  Having an effective Ethics and Compliance program is proven to increase trust within an organization and help people see that speaking up will have a positive impact.</p>

									<p><b>Rationalization</b></p>
									<p>As you learned in the <i>Science of Dishonesty</i> course, there is a human tendency to rationalize unethical behavior, and we sometimes fail to act in line with our values. For example, the belief that everyone else is engaging in the same behavior may mean that not only do we fail to raise ethical concerns, but we may also willingly engage in unethical behavior.</p>

                               <div class="p_box4 box">
									<p><b>Skills </b></p>
									<p>Research shows that practicing or rehearsing how to speak up in advance increases our likelihood of raising concerns when they arise in the workplace and that is the focus of this course. As part of this course, you will begin to build ethical muscle memory and practice voicing your concerns through an approach called Giving Voice to Values (GVV).</p>
