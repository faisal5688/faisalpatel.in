										 <p>In your career &mdash; and your life &mdash; thus far, you have likely encountered situations when your values conflicted with what you were asked to do. Often it is not easy to align your own personal values and purpose with
                                        those of your boss, your co-workers, your direct reports, your customers/clients, or your firm at work (and of course, with others in life more generally). This exercise is designed to help you identify and develop
                                        the competencies necessary to achieve that alignment.</p>
