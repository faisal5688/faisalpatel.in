								<p>Giving Voice to Values (GVV) is an evidence-based approach to ethics and integrity that builds ethical skills to speak up when it matters most.</p>
								<p>GVV was developed by Mary C. Gentile, PhD, to build ethical muscle memory and a strength of habit so that you are ready to voice your values when it matters most. Mary is the creator and director of GVV, as well as a professor of practice at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business, senior adviser at the Aspen Institute Business and Society Program, and consultant on management education and leadership development. The Yale School of Management was Maryâ€™s founding partner for GVV, along with the Aspen Institute, which also served as the incubator of GVV. From 2009-2015, GVV was hosted and supported by Babson College. Darden Business Publishing now manages and delivers the full GVV curriculum as part of its business school.</p>
